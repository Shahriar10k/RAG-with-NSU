            "NSU: A BRIEF HISTORY\n",
            "North South University (NSU), the first private university in Bangladesh, was established in 1992 by the then Foundation for Promotion of Education and Research (FPER), a charitable, non-profit, non-commercial and non-political organization. The FPER later was renamed as the NSU Foundation and is presently called The North South Foundation for Education and Research. The Foundation is comprised of a group of eminent industrialists, prominent patrons of education, notable philanthropists, widely experienced academics and senior civil servants of the country. In the early 1990s, they had a dream to set up a world-class university as a center of excellence in higher education in the private sector. Their dedication, tireless efforts, and hard work paved the way for the approval of the establishment of NSU.\n",
            "Since, at that time, there was no relevant law in the country to set up and operate a university in the private sector, they took the entire burden on themselves and extended their best efforts in assisting the then government in formulating the relevant law and enacting it. Subsequently, the government, pursuant to the newly enacted law the Private University Act (PUA)-1992 (now repealed by PUA-2010), approved the establishment of NSU. The University was formally inaugurated on 10 February 1993 and started its journey in a very modest way. Later, in 2012, the NSU Foundation, in the light of the PUA 2010 and as instructed by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission, formed the NSU Trust with the same group of people as the Foundation and vested the entire management and administration of NSU in its Board of Trustees (BOT). The Honorable President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is the Chancellor of NSU.\n",
            "The Board of Trustees (BOT) is the apex policy making and approving body of the university. Mr. M. A. Kashem is the current Chairman of the BOT. A renowned industrialist of the country.\n",
            "None\n",
            "The Syndicate is next to the BOT and is headed by the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the University. He is responsible for managing the administrative and academic affairs of the university as per the Private University Act (PUA 2010), and implementing the policy guidelines set by the BOT. The Vice-Chancellor is assisted by a Pro Vice-Chancellor and a Treasurer. All of them are appointed by the Honorable Chancellor on recommendation of the BOT.\n",

            "Quality Assurance in Higher Education is a global practice now. It has become vital for higher education to be closely aligned with the needs of the community and needs of the graduates to explore their potential in terms of employability and lifelong learning. Understanding the emerging need of quality in higher education, the Government of Bangladesh established Institutional Quality Assurance Cells (IQAC) at different universities. At North South University (NSU), the Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) was established on January 12, 2016. The NSU-IQAC aspires to help establish a culture of quality in both academic and administrative support operations and to support the university accomplish its vision to become and remain a center of excellence in higher education in Bangladesh and beyond. We intend to use the IQAC as the “go to place” for all quality related resources and information at NSU.\n",

            "We envision the IQAC to support and promote quality teaching, learning and research that will directly impact the quality of our graduates. Better quality graduates will translate to better prepared workforce and will produce responsible global citizens. Since its inception, NSU-IQAC is working to familiarize Outcome Based Education (OBE) among the stakeholders and has adopted Outcome Based curriculum as the core practice of the university.  It will not only improve the skill set of the graduates but it will also incorporate broader issues of tolerance, diversity, sustainability and environmental responsibility among our graduates. North South University aims to establish an evidence based decision system that supports and sustains a culture of integrity, transparency, and accountability. Last but not least, IQAC at NSU wants to contribute in creating an environment where all stakeholders are equally valued and respected. I am very delighted to be with the IQAC since its beginning. I seek your valuable support and cooperation in this journey of IQAC and I strongly believe, with your support, IQAC at NSU can become a pioneer in the Higher Education sector of Bangladesh.\n",

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
