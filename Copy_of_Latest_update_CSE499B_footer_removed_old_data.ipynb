I'm currently working on my master's in architecture, so I can give you a rough idea of what I've learned. The first thing you need to know about architecture is that it's a very broad field. There are a lot of different types of architecture, and there are many different styles of architecture. For example, if you want to know how to build a house, you have to know a lot about the history of the building, how it was built, what materials it was made of, how the building was built out of, and so on. The second thing you should know is that architecture is a very diverse field. It's not just about the building itself, it's also about the people who work in it, how they think about it, and how it relates to the rest of the world.

NSU is fully accredited by the University Grants Commission, the only national accreditation authority in Bangladesh. The School of Business and Economics at NSU is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) making NSU the first institute to receive American accreditation for its programs in the entire country. NSU is the only university in Bangladesh proud to claim that all core faculty members have degrees from reputed international institutes. Securing degrees mostly from North America and Europe, the faculty members have a rich knowledge and expertise in their particular fields. NSU also has a few international faculty members from North America, Europe, and South Asian countries to enrich the quality of teaching and learning. If you don’t believe it, check our programs and faculty member’s profiles on our website at www.northsouth.edu. North South University has been a hub for international exposure. We have student enrollment from 16 countries: Somalia, Gambia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar, China, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Egypt, and Norway. This number keeps increasing each year with new Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) signed with different international universities and organizations. NSU has MOU with universities like Texas A&M University, the George Washington University, University of Maryland, New York Institute of Technology, University of Plymouth, University of Bergen, Humboldt University of Berlin, University of South Australia, Macquarie University, RMIT University, and the University of Canberra. Currently, NSU has approximately 150 international students pursuing their undergraduate and graduate degrees. NSU follows an American curriculum and the medium of instruction is entirely in the English language. Therefore, students can easily experience an American education in non-American place. Education is expensive. This is even worse for international students. When international students go abroad for their further education, it costs almost ten times more than what the local students pay. This is a huge burden for international students. However, in NSU, we believe in equality and fairness. Therefore, the tuition fee for everyone is the same, regardless of their nationality. For information on tuition fees, go to http://www.northsouth.edu/tuition-fees.html and find out how much your desired program would cost. We can guarantee the total cost would still be way lower than most other renowned universities in the world. Furthermore, if you are talented and have an excellent academic record, you can apply for scholarships from the Financial Aid Office. It is possible to study at the university with a 100% scholarship if you are academically meritorious. NSU aims to produce competent graduates in their selected disciplines who will have productive careers or choose to engage in advanced studies. NSU’s students will be “life-long learners with good leadership skills, more proficient in oral, written and electronic communication, critical thinkers with well-developed analytical skills, ethical and socially responsible, champions of diversity and tolerance and globally aware with a commitment to social justice and sustainability” (Vision, Mission & Strategy, NSU website).

NSU is fully accredited by the University Grants Commission, the only national accreditation authority in Bangladesh. The School of Business and Economics at NSU is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) making NSU the first institute to receive American accreditation for its programs in the entire country. NSU is the only university in Bangladesh proud to claim that all core faculty members have degrees from reputed international institutes. Securing degrees mostly from North America and Europe, the faculty members have a rich knowledge and expertise in their particular fields. NSU also has a few international faculty members from North America, Europe, and South Asian countries to enrich the quality of teaching and learning. If you don’t believe it, check our programs and faculty member’s profiles on our website at www.northsouth.edu. North South University has been a hub for international exposure. We have student enrollment from 16 countries: Somalia, Gambia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar, China, Korea, Japan, Turkey, Egypt, and Norway. This number keeps increasing each year with new Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) signed with different international universities and organizations. NSU has MOU with universities like Texas A&M University, the George Washington University, University of Maryland, New York Institute of Technology, University of Plymouth, University of Bergen, Humboldt University of Berlin, University of South Australia, Macquarie University, RMIT University, and the University of Canberra. Currently, NSU has approximately 150 international students pursuing their undergraduate and graduate degrees. NSU follows an American curriculum and the medium of instruction is entirely in the English language. Therefore, students can easily experience an American education in non-American place. Education is expensive. This is even worse for international students. When international students go abroad for their further education, it costs almost ten times more than what the local students pay. This is a huge burden for international students. However, in NSU, we believe in equality and fairness. Therefore, the tuition fee for everyone is the same, regardless of their nationality. For information on tuition fees, go to http://www.northsouth.edu/tuition-fees.html and find out how much your desired program would cost. We can guarantee the total cost would still be way lower than most other renowned universities in the world. Furthermore, if you are talented and have an excellent academic record, you can apply for scholarships from the Financial Aid Office. It is possible to study at the university with a 100% scholarship if you are academically meritorious. NSU aims to produce competent graduates in their selected disciplines who will have productive careers or choose to engage in advanced studies. NSU’s students will be “life-long learners with good leadership skills, more proficient in oral, written and electronic communication, critical thinkers with well-developed analytical skills, ethical and socially responsible, champions of diversity and tolerance and globally aware with a commitment to social justice and sustainability” (Vision, Mission & Strategy, NSU website).

            "Passage: allied professionals to team up with core teachers to provide input in design studios. The total teaching family the students are exposed to in the five years of their study are core members, part-time teachers and guest speakers all of whom have one thing in common- the dedication and enthusiasm to go beyond the ordinary learning of architecture into an arena of critical academic exchange and enrichment. To become an architect, students must earn an accredited, professional degree in Architecture, the B.Arch. At NSU, the undergraduate architecture education is comprised of a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program. The program prepares students for professional practice in architecture. Students are educated on the basic principles of architecture and the precedents that have influenced those principles. Established in 2005, the curriculum is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and accredited by the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB). It is closely based on the North American educational system for Architects and aligned with the structure of the commonly accredited professional programs by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) of USA, the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CCAB-CCCA) of Canada and the educational requirements for licensing and certification by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) of USA. It satisfies fully the requirements for Architectural education guidelines set by the United Nation’s Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Commonwealth Association of Architects (CAA), the International Union of Architects (UIA) and the Architects Regional Council Asia (ARCASIA). The curriculum is the third registered program recognized by the Supreme Education Council of Qatar, under Qatar’s Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA) - Engineering Committee. It is a five-year (fifteen-semester) program of 170 credit hours. The first four-years of the degree program are faculty driven and stress on the education of the individual and serves as the foundation for advanced study in the discipline. The final year studio involves the design of a building in depth. The studio consists of a student-initiated final project, which has been identified, researched, and programmed mostly by the student with general parameters set by the faculty. Required and elective professional courses in practice, history and theory, architectural technologies, urbanism, energy studies and environmental systems complement the education of the architect in the studios. To become a licensed architect in Bangladesh, the primary requirement is an accredited five-year B.Arch degree. The remaining requirements for licensure are a minimum period of two years of professional training under an architect and a passing score on the Oral Examination or Architectural Registration Examination administered by the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB). IAB full members are registered with the Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakhkha (RAJUK) or the various municipalities in the district towns, to practice as licensed architects. The courses in architecture are divided into six broad based areas: 1. General Education 21.0 Credits 2. Core Studio Courses 77.5 3. Core Lecture Courses 46.0 4. Optional Courses 13.5 5. Open Electives 6 to 9 6. Professional Electives 3 to 6 Minimum Credits for Degree 170 General\n"
